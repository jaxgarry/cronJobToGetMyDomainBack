# cronJobToGetMyDomainBack
Life happened and in the midst of searching for a place to live as my lease end date crept up, I forgot to renew my domain. Now jaxgarry.com is at risk of being snatched by someone else. For the time being, it is being held ransom (for $200) by some insane third party reseller that nameCheap has partnered with. This cron job is set up to check on my domain daily and will send me an email the moment that my domain is released to the world for purchase. I plan on having this cron job check the DNS of my domain twice a day and use a diff to determine if I should be emailed. My domain will be released to the public "approximately 80-120 days from the expiration date".  The hunt is a foot!
